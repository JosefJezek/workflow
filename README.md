## Context-Driven Development with AI

- I use context-driven development to leverage AI models effectively.
- I provide AI models with relevant context from the codebase to improve their understanding and output quality.
- This approach helps AI models generate more accurate and context-aware code suggestions, reducing errors and improving overall code quality.

## 📋 Spec-Driven Development Workflow

I use Spec Kit for structured, specification-driven development with AI assistance.

[Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit#readme) is a tool for creating, managing, and validating software specifications.

[Specification-Driven Development](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/blob/main/spec-driven.md) (SDD) is a development methodology that emphasizes creating detailed specifications before writing code. It ensures that the final product meets the defined requirements and behaves as expected.

### 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

I combine Spec Kit with TDD to ensure code quality and correctness.

### 🔄 Spec files can be updated

To update the spec file, you need to create a new git branch with the same prefix as the spec file folder.
For example, to update `specs/001-login-page/spec.md`, create a branch named `001-fix-submit-button`.

```sh
git checkout -b 001-fix-submit-button
/speckit.clarify Update the login page to fix the alignment issue of the submit button.
/speckit.plan Test cases should be updated accordingly to cover the new changes.
/speckit.tasks
/speckit.implement
```

### 📝 Workflow Steps

<details>
<summary>Click to expand workflow details</summary>

#### 1️⃣ Establish project principles

Use the **`/speckit.constitution`** command to create your project's governing principles and development guidelines that will **guide all subsequent development**.

TDD is optional in Spec Kit, but I enforce it strictly in my projects.

```bash
/speckit.constitution
Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards,
user experience consistency, and performance requirements.
This React project follows a "Library-First" approach where all features 
are implemented as standalone, reusable components and hooks first.
We prefer functional components with hooks over class components.
We use Test-Driven Development strictly with React Testing Library.
Breaking code into smaller modules is crucial - keep files around 250 lines.
Prioritize accessibility (a11y), semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation.
Components should be pure and side-effect free where possible.
Use TypeScript in strict mode for type safety and better developer experience.
```

#### 2️⃣ Create the spec file

Use the **`/speckit.specify`** command to describe what you want to build.
Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the tech stack.

The command will create new git branches for each spec file.

**Do not focus on the tech stack at this point.**

```bash
/speckit.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.
```

##### Clarify any ambiguities or missing details in the spec using the **`/speckit.clarify`** command

```bash
/speckit.clarify Focus on user-friendly design and intuitive drag-and-drop functionality. Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

/speckit.clarify Add support for common image formats like JPEG, PNG, and GIF. Include basic photo editing features such as cropping and rotating within the album view.
```

##### Validate the specification checklist using the `/speckit.checklist` command

```bash
/speckit.checklist
```

#### 3️⃣ Create a technical implementation plan

Use the **`/speckit.plan`** command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.

```bash
/speckit.plan The application uses Vite with a minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.
```

#### 4️⃣ Break down into tasks

Use **`/speckit.tasks`** to create an actionable task list from your implementation plan.

```bash
/speckit.tasks
```

##### Optionally, validate the plan with `/speckit.analyze`:

```bash
/speckit.analyze
```

#### 5️⃣ Execute implementation

Use **`/speckit.implement`** to execute all tasks and build your feature according to the plan.

```bash
/speckit.implement
```

### 📊 Comparisons

- [Claude Opus 4.5 vs GPT 5.2 High vs Gemini 3 Pro](https://dev.to/tensorlake/claude-opus-45-vs-gpt-52-high-vs-gemini-3-pro-production-coding-test-25of)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand more comparisons</summary>

- Sorry but in like 90% of cases GLM 4.7 (thinking!) is not even close to Opus 4.5. We are using both across multiple GH orgs tons of repos mostly larger JS and PHP codebases. The way Opus does things is just on a totally different level it actually seems aware of the consequences of every single change and catches stuff GLM skips entirely. Please dont just rely on benchmark data when saying they are on the same level for coding because thats simply not true.
- Agreed. Over 3 hours today, Opus 4.5 helped me ship a feature I've spent 100+ hours on over the past 6 months (to no avail). The closest any other model got was GPT 5.2 and only today did I realize how terribly far off it was to the real solution. Today Opus 4.5 and I did it in 3 hours. It's the only model that seems to truly think.
- That is absolutely true. All these clickbaits are just a waste of time. Nothing comes close to Opus 4.5 if you are a developer/ vibe-coder. I believed this nonsense once and configured GLM 4.7 in Claude Code CLI. Tried it for 2 days. Terrible! Even Codex 5.2 is far far behind Opus 4.5. All these clickbait videos need to stop!!!
